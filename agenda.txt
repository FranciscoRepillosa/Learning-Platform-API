[x] make the unlogged users be able to see intro videos 
(so far i think i would diferent routes just to treaat free resources like intro videos)

[x] when the user clicks in 'buy course' ask if he is login 
(if he's not redirect to login screen otherwise keeps the flow)
   
   - make a route to check if a user is login if he's not create a 
   cookie to save the course to brought, then redurect 
   to login page and when login check the cookie and redirect to
   buy the course

---- SIDE NOTES -----
I ESPEND COUPLES OF DAYS TRIYING TO ACCESS TO AN AUNTHENTICATED ROUTE,
THE PROBLEM WAS THE FOLLOWING: IN THE BACKEND SIDE, ONE OF THE CORS POLICY
RULES WAS 'CREDENTIALS: TRUE' (WHICH MEANS THE GIVEN REQUESTS WILL HAVE
CREDENTIALS HEADERS ) BUT IN CLIENT SIDE I WAS MAKING REQUEST WITHOUT
ESPECIFIES THE 'WIHTCREDENTIALS: TRUE'
